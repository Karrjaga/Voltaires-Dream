Should we grant this request or keep the city for ourselves?"
 vn_flavor_apl.100.a: "Hand over the city to the [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 vn_flavor_apl.100.b: "We have conquered it, so it belongs to us!"

 vn_flavor_apl.102.t: "A Sicilian County?"
 vn_flavor_apl.102.d: "In 1059, Pope Nicholas II granted Robert Guiscard the title of Count of Sicily to encourage him to conquer the island. After Robert Guiscard captured the city of Palermo in 1071, he transferred the title and the majority of the island to his younger brother Roger Bosso. From then on, Roger Bosso's descendants ruled the island until Roger II of Sicily inherited the Duchy of Apulia-Calabria from his relatives in 1127. Thus, the mainland and the island were once again in the hands of a single ruler, whereupon Roger II united the territories under the new Kingdom of Sicily with the consent of Antipope Anacletus II.\nHaving established our own presence in Sicily, the question arises as to whether we should entrust the island to Roger Bosso so that he can focus entirely on its administration while we take care of the mainland."

 vn_flavor_apl.103.d: "During the Second Crusade in 1147, Sicilian troops under King Roger II also attacked the Byzantine cities of Thebes and Corinth. The local silk weaving mills were looted and the high-quality silk production techniques were stolen and taken to Sicily. Many silk farmers and weavers were forcibly resettled to Sicily, which led to the flourishing of silk industry in Palermo and Calabria.\nWith our recent raid on a foreign silk production facility, we have also come into possession of the coveted silkworms and weaving equipment. Where do we want to set up a new center for our silk production?"
 vn_flavor_apl.103.a: "[sicilian_silk_1] is the best choice."
 vn_flavor_apl.103.b: "Our main place for silk production should be [sicilian_silk_2]."
 vn_flavor_apl.103.c: "[sicilian_silk_3] seems to be the most suitable to our plans."
