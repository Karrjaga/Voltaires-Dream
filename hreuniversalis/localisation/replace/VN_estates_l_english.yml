In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion.

 estate_disasters.98.d: "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move. Their great influence over local cities as well as over many matters in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] has allowed them to prepare to break off into an entirely new state."
 estate_disasters.98.a: "We should have reined them in"

 estate_disasters.98.c: "Abdicate the throne"
 mamluks_estate_events.1.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GetMamluksName]"
 mamluks_estate_events.1.d: "The disgruntled $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of [Root.GetName] have risen up against us to reclaim their rights once granted by the state."
 mamluks_estate_events.1.a: "Okay."
 mamluks_estate_events.2.t: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ Demand Rights"
 mamluks_estate_events.2.d: "The institution of slavery in the Islamic world is quite different to European colonial chattel slavery, and more reminiscent of the institution as it existed in ancient Greece or Rome. As such, $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ were often employed in household settings as bookkeepers, guardians, personal assistants, or other relatively tolerable roles, and amassed considerable rights over time. A group of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for sweeping rights that very well challenge the notion of who is slave and who is master."
 mamluks_estate_events.2.a: "Very well"
 mamluks_estate_events.2.b: "We cannot accept this"
 mamluks_estate_events.3.t: "Wafidiyya Request Asylum"
 mamluks_estate_events.3.d: "The term 'Wafidiyya' refers to refugee soldiers of various backgrounds who would serve in the armies of Islamic states in return for asylum and pay. The expectation was that after they had loyally served the state, they would receive a land grant. A large group of Wafidiyya fleeing some manner of devastation in Central Asia has come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] offering their service, but it remains to be seen whether we can afford to accept their terms."
 mamluks_estate_events.3.a: "We have more than enough space"
 mamluks_estate_events.3.b: "Turn them away"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.t: "Conflict Between $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.1: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Turkish and Circassian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. A Turkish commander and a Circassian accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.2: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Franji (European) and African $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An African commander and a European accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.3: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Saqaliba (Slavic) and native Iberian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An Iberian commander and a Slavic accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.a: "Side with the commander"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.b: "Side with the accountant"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.t: "Abuse of the Dhimmi"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.d: "Just as the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are comprised of ethnic minorities, the religious minorities form an important part of our realm in their status as Dhimmi. They pay the jizya tax loyally and expect protection and tolerance in turn from the government. We have received complaints, however, that certain $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ began jeering at a group of infidel practitioners and ended up assaulting them in an all-out brawl. The Dhimmi collectively demand we address this outrage and punish the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ responsible."
 mamluks_estate_events.5.a: "Jail them"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.b: "Execute them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.c: "Who cares?"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.t: "Halqa and $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.d: "The core of our military structure is the division between slave-soldiers and freeborn professional soldiers, known in Arabic as al-Halqa. In one of our recent campaigns, a group of experienced $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ suggested that we would be strategically better off with them having command precedence over their Halqa counterparts. There may be truth to this claim, but at the same time agreeing to the proposal would perhaps be granting the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ a dangerous amount of power."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.a: "We can keep them in line..."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.b: "Preserve the status quo"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.t: "Conspiracy Thwarted"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.d: "Succession in a Mamluk Sultanate is a complex and ambiguous issue. As such, different factions of [Root.GetMamluksName] frequently plotted against and assassinated reigning monarchs to install themselves into power. It was through this very method that the [Root.GetMamluksName] took over from their erstwhile lords in the first place. Word of just such a conspiracy has come to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], apparently headed by one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] old rivals.\nWhat should be done about this insolence?"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.a: "Execute the ringleaders"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.b: "Bribe them"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.t: "Unrest in the Barracks"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.d: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are usually sold to [Root.GetAdjective] traders at a young age, and from then on they are raised in barracks in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be trained in the most advanced military arts. In theory their foreign origin keeps them disinterested in domestic power struggles, but in practice the opposite is often true. Apparently a contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has been causing trouble over food quality in the barracks and compelling their brethren toward disloyalty as well."
 mamluks_estate_events.8.a: "There is little we can do"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.t: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ Conspire With Foreign Power"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.d: "Despite all their privileges, the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ never cease to feel resentment at their status. Throughout history there have been attempts to overthrow extant powers and establish new independent dynasties ruled by the descendants of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$. To this end, a certain cadre of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has gone behind our back to work with one of our sworn enemies. These scoundrels have supplied the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ with weapons for an insurrection against the state, which is set to launch immediately."
 mamluks_estate_events.9.a: "Curse them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.t: "A Grand Tournament"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.d: "The prestige of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ was tied to their patron and vice versa. $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ frequently would entertain themselves with sporting games involving martial prowess in addition to their weekly Furusiyya cavalry drills. The court has been asked to fund a grand demonstration that will show off $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ from the households of noblemen around the realm, though funding the usual Furusiyya shows already drains the state's coffers considerably."
 mamluks_estate_events.10.a: "Pay for the games"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.b: "We need the money"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.t: "Incorporation of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.d: "Our recent military victories have led us to a quandary - what should be done with the hostile contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ that is now at our mercy? If we incorporate them into our own ranks we can expect their loyalty, but at the same time, continual combination of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ into larger and larger groups could end up threatening the power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mamluks_estate_events.11.a: "Welcome them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.b: "Disband them"
 monopoly_privileges.11.d: "The monopoly on slaves we granted to the [Root.GetMamluksName] has expired, meaning that we are now able to reclaim the income from slave trading. However, the [Root.GetMamluksName] are keen to keep their privileges and are offering to pay us a lump sum in return for the monopoly being guaranteed for a further 10 years."

 rajputs_estate_events.3.t: "Declining Power of the Arteshtaran"
 rajputs_estate_events.3.d: "A series of internecine struggles brought about by feuding kin groups has weakened Arteshtaran influence in [Root.Country.GetName]. Unable or unwilling to devote their full attention to [Root.GetAdjective] political or military affairs, their influence at court has very much suffered."
 rajputs_estate_events.4.t: "Marriage Alliances with the Arteshtaran"
 rajputs_estate_events.4.d: "Kinship is of paramount importance to the Arteshtaran clans, and as such there is no better way to cement their loyalty than by forging marriage alliances. Several of the most powerful Arteshtaran grandees have offered to wed their daughters into our line in exchange for a guarantee that they will continue to hold their ancestral lands and titles. Though some among the Arteshtaran leaders consider this an unacceptable act of sublimation, those that have offered marriage ties do so with plans to advance their position at court."
 rajputs_estate_events.5.t: "Arteshtaran Scion Seeks New Territory"
 rajputs_estate_events.5.d: "Arteshtaran power in the Middle East is predicated on centuries of conquest, colonization, and settlement of lands beyond their power base in Persia. A particularly bold and ambitious scion of a notable clan has appeared at court on a quest to enhance the prestige of his kin. Approaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he asks permission to settle [rajput_scion_province.GetName], where he shall found a new town. He promises in exchange to accept the rule of the [Root.Country.GetName] state and to raise an army in our support whenever it is needed."
 rajputs_estate_events.6.t: "The Arteshtaran Make Demands"
 rajputs_estate_events.6.d: "Arteshtaran nobles have come to both outnumber and outrank all other nobility at the [Root.GetAdjective] court. They know well the power they wield over our armies and our administration, and have leveraged this power to demand extreme concessions to Arteshtaran nobles and their territories. Our attempts to curb their power through subtle means have had little effect, and so we must consider taking drastic action; either we must accept that the Arteshtaran are a law unto themselves, or we must strip them of their noble ranks to restore balance to the court."
 rajputs_estate_events.7.t: "Integration of Arteshtaran Nobility"
 rajputs_estate_events.7.d: "Arteshtaran nobles are a common sight at the court of [Root.Country.GetName], though it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between them and the other courtiers that make their home in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The Arteshtaran at court have been thoroughly integrating into [Root.GetAdjective] aristocratic society, going so far as to learn the [Root.Culture.GetName] language, observe [Root.GetAdjective] courtly etiquette, and personally accompany the [Root.Monarch.GetName] wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. This is leading to the loss of a distinctly Arteshtaran voice at court, as these nobles have become more concerned with their personal advancement than in the interests of the Arteshtaran community."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.t: "The Arteshtaran Rebellion"
 rajputs_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between [Root.Country.GetName] and the Arteshtaran clans could hardly be worse. The marginalization of Arteshtaran nobles and the neglect of Arteshtaran soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. Though it has become traditional for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to formally appoint Arteshtaran clan leaders, in the current state of crisis our preferred candidate has been unanimously rejected by his would-be subjects. The Arteshtaran of [Root.Country.GetName] now demand the right to appoint their own leadership, and to be left to govern their own affairs in provinces they control. They are prepared to install their chosen leader by force if we insist on maintaining our chokehold on dynastic politics."
 rajputs_estate_events.9.t: "Arteshtaran Daena"
 rajputs_estate_events.9.d: "The cornerstone of Arteshtaran identity is their Daena, which they derive from the moral guidance in their bardic writings. Every Arteshtaran leader must put kinship above all else, surrounding himself with a brotherhood of warriors and advisors all sharing descent from a patrilineal ancestor. Arteshtaran soldiers must fight and die in service to their masters; nothing but absolute loyalty is acceptable.\n\nRather than attempting to suppress these traditional Arteshtaran values and power structures, [Root.Country.GetName] has encouraged them, harmonizing them with service to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The Arteshtaran see no contradiction between their Daena and their duty to us."
 rajputs_estate_events.11.t: "The Arteshtaran Aristocratic Diaspora"
 rajputs_estate_events.11.d: "Arteshtaran nobility has spread far and wide throughout the centuries, but a strong sense of kinship identity creates a common aristocratic culture. Arteshtaran chiefs know their status and history in relation to other Arteshtaran going back many generations.\n\nOur advisors, among them many Arteshtaran, suggest that these bonds could be exploited to the benefit of [Root.Country.GetName]. Most obviously, the Arteshtaran chiefs loyal to us could act as ambassadors to the Arteshtaran of nearby nations, enhancing our reputation in foreign courts. A more cunning option would be to exploit ancient grudges among the Arteshtaran as a means to claim foreign territory."

There are even rumours that [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has joined in Zanda rituals. Though a small religious minority, the Zanda are gaining power in politics and society."
 jains_estate_events.3.t: "Zanda Influence Declines"
 jains_estate_events.3.d: "The Zanda once again find themselves lacking in social capital. Prominent ascetics have managed to get themselves exiled from court following a series of religious and political disagreements, and Zanda merchants find their fortunes are waning. Zanda influence is on the decline."
 jains_estate_events.4.t: "Zanda Resist Persecution"
 jains_estate_events.4.d: "The Zanda community of [Root.Country.GetName] have become utterly disloyal following many acts of disrespect and persecution by the state. The situation has become great exacerbated by an outrageous act of sacrilege. Unwilling to accept further persecution, the Zanda community has resolved to oppose our government. Their methods of resistance are unorthodox yet effective; rather than rising up in violent rebellion they boycott institutions of state, deny loans, and refuse all participation in government. Our reliance on the Zanda community has become a damning vulnerability."
 jains_estate_events.5.t: "Zanda Moneylenders Call in Debts"
 jains_estate_events.5.d: "Several prominent Hutukhshan guilds have accumulated substantial debts to Zanda banking families. Unwilling to pay up, representatives of these guilds have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for forgiveness of their debt. They argue that their finances will be ruined if they are forced to continue making payments, though the Zanda moneylenders retort that their inability to pay is due to their own mismanagement.

Several Asronan families also engage in banking. Representatives of these Asronan argue the case for favoring their services over the Zanda. While they cannot offer the same low interest rates, they stress that the confidence of the Zoroastrian people in Asronan leadership will correspond to increased faith in the [Root.GetAdjective] economy."

They have been granted positions in the administration, control over Zanda pilgrimage sites, and preferential treatment in the taxation system. Our heavy patronage has at last paid off; they have offered us the service of a number of skilled financiers to aid our administration, and donated a large sum to our coffers.

 jains_estate_events.8.d: "The holiest period of the religious calendar of many Zanda in [Root.GetName] has come. It is a time of fasting, austerity, and absolution. Members of the Zanda community use this time for prayer, meditation, and asking forgiveness from their fellows.\nZanda ministers employed in the [Root.GetAdjective] administration have petitioned the state to ask that the slaughter of animals be prohibited for the duration of this time. While a costly proposal for our butchers, it has been suggested that the state could make up for the loss of profit."

They mean to achieve this status through the enactment of policies granting religious concessions. These would include the prohibition of animal slaughter, ending the confiscation of the property of the deceased, abolishing religious taxes, and the release of political prisoners with ties to prominent Zanda families.\n\nThese proposals have been met with outrage from the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy, and are likely to be unpopular throughout the realm.

 marathas_estate_events.2.d: "A great poet has emerged from among the Wuzurgan. Hailed as a living saint, the poet preaches equality before Ahura Mazda and defiance of caste restrictions. He writes of the Asronan:\n\n'Ahura Mazda’s servants have no caste,\nThe Yasna’s science so decrees.\nWhich of your books have saved the fallen?\nI know of none.'\n\nArguing that a man is only as chaste as his own faith and emphasizing personal salvation over ritual observances, his teachings have angered the Asronan of [Root.Country.GetName].

 marathas_estate_events.3.d: "Facing an enemy that fields powerful artillery, our Wuzurgan advisors propose the adoption of a tactic that has served them well in the past. Focused on light and medium cavalry armed with lances and bows, it is a form of hit-and-run warfare that favors highly mobile cavalry flanking maneuvers. The smaller, lighter horses favored by them are ideal for such missions, able to outmaneuver cumbersome artillery, elephants, and heavy cavalry."
 EST_VAL_BARGIRS: "Enlisted Dehqan: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 marathas_estate_events.4.t: "Horses for the Dehqan"
 marathas_estate_events.4.d: "The Dehqan, Wuzurgan cavalrymen in [Root.Country.GetName]’s employ, traditionally have their horses provided for them by their patron. In recent months a decline in available mounts and a consequent rise in prices has made this a financially daunting prospect. The state could procure the necessary horses at an increased cost, but if the price proves unacceptable we may have to ask that the Dehqan meet the cost themselves."
 marathas_estate_events.5.t: "Militarization of the Wuzurgan"
 marathas_estate_events.5.d: "The Wuzurgan bring with them a hardened martial culture to the lands they rule. They maintain close ties with the peasantry and lower castes, favoring an egalitarian outlook over a belief in the inherent worth of nobility. Unlike many Persian armies, which typically draw their manpower from the ranks of the nobility, the Wuzurgan raise legions of peasant-soldiers skilled in guerrilla warfare. Though unendowed with the excellence of noble and illustrious birth, their martial experience makes them superior to the easy and effeminate troops of our enemies."
 marathas_estate_events.6.d: "The increasing militarization of the Wuzurgan has ecological drawbacks. Where the peasantry once tended the fields, they now stand to gain easy riches by serving half the year as soldiers. Labor shortages plus an increasing demand for warhorses are making traditional agriculture difficult and unprofitable, making the land more vulnerable to famines. Many are turning towards pastoralism; cattle can be herded with a smaller labor force, can be driven into forests during a drought, or hidden in ravines in times of war. It may be necessary to scale back militarization in [maratha_farming_province.GetName], though the peasantry is unlikely to receive this news well."

 marathas_estate_events.7.d: "[Root.Country.GetName]’s campaigns in the Middle East have brought glory to the Wuzurgan that we entrust to lead our military. Many of these soldiers are returning home with a newfound taste for the luxuries of Arabic culture; Egyptian fragrances, Mesopotamian spices, elaborate works of brass and silver are now in high demand. As the Wuzurgan wield great influence in [Root.Country.GetName], the Wuzurgan nobility have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asking for state patronage of these arts and procurement of exotic goods."
 marathas_estate_events.7.b: "We will not bankroll Arabic decadence."

 marathas_estate_events.8.d: "A Zoroastrian sect centered around the Persian cleric Sunpadh has become popular among the Wuzurgan. Their members are known as Khurramites, occurring simultaneously across many settlements in Persia and remembering Babak Khorramdin who opposed Muslim rule in the 9th century. They wear symbolic red dresses, believe in reincarnation and promote the concept of free love, but still sharing many Zoroastrian principles.\n\nSome among the Asronan see these heretical spiritual movements as a threat to their religious authority. They seek to gain a measure of control over the Khurramites so that they can be integrated into orthodox Zoroastrian worship in accordance with their interpretation of Avestan ritual."
